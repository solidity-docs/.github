# Solidity Documentation Translation Guide

Hello and welcome to the [Solidity documentation](http://docs.soliditylang.org/) translations GitHub organization! Great to have you here. ðŸ˜Š

In this org, we coordinate community-driven translation efforts.

Please note that the Solidity team can give no guarantees on the quality and accuracy of the translations provided. The translations are meant to lower the entry barriers for non-English speaking developers and hence will allow a broader set of developers from all over the world to get to know Solidity. However, the [English reference version](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/tree/develop/docs) is and will remain the **only** officially supported version by the Solidity team and will always be the most accurate and most up-to-date one. When in doubt, always refer to the English (original) documentation.

By uniting all translation efforts in this repository we aim toâ€¦
- Get a broader set of eyes and contributors involved in the translation process.
- Establish quality standards and best practices.
- Help each other and better leverage synergies across the different language translation teams.

### Contributing to the Translations

To find a language to contribute to, browse the [existing repositories](https://github.com/orgs/solidity-docs/repositories). Please coordinate with the respective maintainer of the language. 

You can also join the [Solidity Docs Community Translations](https://app.element.io/#/room/#solidity-docs-translations:matrix.org) room on Matrix to coordinate with other community translators. 

If your language does not yet have a repository, please check out the [maintainer guide](../maintainer-guide.md) on how to start a new language.

### Translation Process

After carefully [evaluating](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10119) different options, we decided in favor of keeping the technicalities of the translation process up to the individual contributors and decided against using a translation tool.

However, in order to make things easier for the contributors and assure some sort of standard, we are proposing to respect the [translation progress checklist](../progress-checklist.md) and working in a translation team of min. 2 people.

### Acknowledgements

Big kudos go out to the [ReactJS translations team repository](https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org-translation) and the [ethereum.org translation team](https://ethereum.org/en/contributing/translation-program/), which both inspired us with their resources and advised on setting up this process.
