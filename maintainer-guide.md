## Maintainer Guide

This document lists the responsibilities and resources available to maintainers of the Solidity documentation translation forks.

### Maintainer Responsibilities

As maintainers of one of the Solidity doc translations we ask you to please:
- Track the process of the translation in the [translation progress checklist](https://github.com/solidity-docs/translation-guide/blob/main/progress-checklist.md).
- Review PRs made by contributors in a timely manner.
- Make sure that the translations follow the [translation style guide](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html#documentation-style-guide) outlined in the Solidity docs.
- Regularly check if the translation is up-to-date.
- Inform the Solidity team once your translation has reached the state where it can be published by adding it to the Solidity docs.
- Act as point of contact for your language and answer questions from both contributors to your language and the core Solidity team.

### Tips

#### Glossary
Consider making a glossary of the translations of technical and Solidity-specific terms. Put this in a highly visible location (the README or a pinned issue).

#### Language-Specific Style Guide
Also, create a style guide to define additional rules to follow in translation. See the general [Solidity docs style guide](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html#documentation-style-guide) for rules that should apply to all translations.

#### Review Process

Decide how many reviewers you want to review each translated page before it can be merged in. If your team is small and busy, you may only be able to have one reviewer so that translators don't get blocked. If your team is bigger, consider having two reviewers so you have a stronger guarantee that the page is correct.

### Need Help or Have Questions?
If you have a question that isn't addressed here, you can visit the [Documentation category](https://forum.soliditylang.org/c/documentation/8) of the Solidity forum and ask your fellow translators for help!

You can also ask for help in the solidity-dev [Gitter](https://gitter.com/ethereum/solidity) or [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#ethereum_solidity:gitter.im) chat.
